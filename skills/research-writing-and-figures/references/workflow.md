# Workflow Reference

## Purpose

This reference captures the reusable workflow and collaboration rules behind the original `AGENTS.md`, but in a form that can travel across projects.

## Working principles

- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions over defensive over-engineering.
- Analyze problems from first principles and verify claims against concrete evidence.
- Treat the highest-value output as an answer to a question, not a log of completed steps.

## Problem-driven structure

When drafting or revising text, always ask:

1. What question is this section answering?
2. What is the core claim?
3. What evidence supports that claim?
4. What boundary, caveat, or implication matters next?

Avoid these failure modes:

- process-driven writing (`First, Second, Third`)
- validation loops that merely prove the method “works”
- defensive wording that anticipates criticism instead of presenting evidence
- stuffing implementation details into the main argument layer
- thread-like writing that mixes several ideas before the reader knows the main point
- renaming the same object across sections and forcing the reader to re-map terms

## Section roles

- `Introduction`: define the problem, the gap, and the core insight
- `Methods`: define data, representation, design, and evaluation protocol
- `Results`: report evidence and direct comparisons
- `Discussion`: explain meaning, mechanism, scope, and limits

Do not let these sections collapse into the same voice.

## Output style

- Keep claims explicit.
- Keep updates and plans concise.
- Prefer Chinese for collaboration summaries when required by the host project.
- Prefer short, structured outputs over long defensive explanations.

## Revision workflow

Use this order by default:

1. Diagnose the writing problem
2. Decide what the section should actually do
3. Rewrite for function, not for surface polish
4. Re-check terms, numbers, and figure references

## Research-to-presentation conversion

When turning paper content into talks or slides:

- keep the scientific core
- reduce jargon
- replace abstract terms with examples when speaking to a mixed audience
- preserve one clear take-home message per segment
